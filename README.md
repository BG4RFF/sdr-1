Simple Digit Recognition OCR in OpenCV-Python
=============================================

This code is originally based on Abid Rahman K's answer in [Simple Digit Recognition OCR in OpenCV-Python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9413216/simple-digit-recognition-ocr-in-opencv-python/9620295).

Several tiny modification has been made to adapt to OpenCV's new API.

Hope it helps for OpenCV beginners.
